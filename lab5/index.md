## Part 1

Student - Hello. I tried writing a reversing function for an array but the reversing doesn't seem to work. Is the swap even working or is it somehow being undone? Code, output, and file structure below.

TA - Hello. You almost got the reversing function working. I would recommend tracing the entire function out from beginning to end.

Student - Hello. I traced the function and saw the issue. It looks like I'm swapping twice, which undos the entire operation. I changed the loop to only iterate for half the length. Thanks for the help. Trace and output are below.

## Part 2

One very interesting thing I learned this half of the class was about unit testing. I was always wondered how programmers tested their code and usually assumed they manually plugged in random values into their functions to see if their code would break. It makes a lot of sense that there are libraries that test values before and after they interact with the function.
